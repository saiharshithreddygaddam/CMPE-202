## Summary: 

In the conventional approach we create three observers "Microsoft", "Apple" and "Google" who get notified about the news when a something related 
to them is mentioned in the news. 

Instead of instantiating three observer objects explicitly we are passing a lambda expression directly to represent the behavior to execute
which reduces the lines of code.
