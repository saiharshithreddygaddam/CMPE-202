## Summary: 

In the conventional approach we create three observers "Microsoft", "Apple" and "Google" who get notified about the news when something related to them is mentioned in the news. Simply, they are wrapping a piece of behaviour when the news is telecasted. 

Instead of instantiating three observer objects explicitly we are passing a lambda expression directly to represent the behavior to execute
which reduces the lines of code.
